### Why?
Start making games now with Angular2 and Phaser!  Seed project is a MEAN stack but all you have to do to start building a game is:

```
git clone https://github.com/allenRoyston/phaser-angular2-demo.git
cd phaser-angular2-demo
npm install
npm start

// open a browser and enter localhost:3000
```

This will install everything and start a local server.  From here, start making the game of your dreams.  A few tips to help you get started.

### Getting Started

- I'd recommend looking over the [Phaser.io](http://phaser.io/ "Phaser.io") website.  You can copy and paste a lot of sample code to get your footing before diving in.
- I'd start with modifying the sample game file located in <strong>public/app/gameDemo/demo.js</strong>.  This is where your game logic will live, and it's completely abstracted from how your site operates (so you can build them independently).   
- The sample game file is structured around preloading assets, loading screens, and then the game cycle.  It takes a lot to make a game, but this should give you a solid foundational start.  
- Lastly, I'd also recommend giving the [directive itself](httpshttps://github.com/allenRoyston/ang2-phaser) a once over.  
- I know this isn't exactly beginner friendly so I'll try and add a better guide in the future.  Just know that you can [make some really awesome stuff](https://www.angularattack.com/entries/1181-totally-not-a-robot/launch) once you have the basics down.  That entry was made in roughly 38 hours.
